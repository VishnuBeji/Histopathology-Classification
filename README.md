# Histopathology-Classification

We have used Resnet-18 pretrained model and Vision Transformer to perform the classification. We observe slightly better performance with Vision Transformers.

The dataset is de-identified and released with permission from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health (D-HH) Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

The images fall into either of these classes:
